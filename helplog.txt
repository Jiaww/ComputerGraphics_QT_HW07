Have to Change the data structure of the Mesh
Solved:
In homework 5, I store the normal and color in each vertex, and this results there are 24 vertices in a cube mesh. Which means there are 3 vertices represent the same vertex. This will result lots of problems in more complicated operation, so I change the data structure of the mesh class, and calculate the normal and color in the create() function, finally, set the mesh only has 8 vertices for one cube.

How to Triangulate a polygon with more than four edges?
Solved:
Just as the same method to split a quadrangle, and create a new face which only has three edges. And then continue to triangulate the remain polygon until it has three edges.

When subdivision the Cow and the deeper subdivision of the cube, the program will crash.
Unsolved:
I examine step by step and find out that it will crash when the calling of the create(), I think it may be the hardware problem, my computer may cannot do such complicated computation by its GPU.

Solved:
All of the vertices of the sharp face will be sharp, too.
